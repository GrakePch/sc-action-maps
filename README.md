# Star Citizen Keybinding Visualizer

A WIP react app that visualizes the complicated action maps of Star Citizen with icons.

A preview for the current build. This is not the final design. Only showing the default keybindings. Squares with texts are placeholders for the actions that do not have an icon, and will be assigned with an icon in the future updates.

## Icon sources

Most are original. Some of the icons are inspired by [icons from Star Citizen](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/pledge/ships/gladius/Gladius#holo-viewer) and [Material Design Icons](https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/), or modified from them (as part of the icon), or use them as the whole icon.
