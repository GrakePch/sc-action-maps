## Icon sources

Most are original. Some of the icons are inspired by [icons from Star Citizen](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/pledge/ships/gladius/Gladius#holo-viewer) and [Material Design Icons](https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/), or modified from them (as part of the icon), or use them as the whole icon.
